# GAN on MNIST Dataset

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate handwritten digits similar to those found in the MNIST dataset. The project is implemented in **PyTorch** with the **Generator** and **Discriminator** defined in separate modules for clean and modular design.

## 🧠 What is a GAN?

A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** consists of two models:

- **Generator**: Tries to produce realistic-looking handwritten digits from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: Tries to distinguish between real MNIST digits and fake ones generated by the Generator.

The two models are trained in an adversarial setting, where the Generator improves to fool the Discriminator and the Discriminator improves to detect fake images.
