# Autoencoder on MNIST Dataset (TensorFlow)

This project implements an **Autoencoder** using **TensorFlow** to learn compressed representations of handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The Autoencoder is trained to reconstruct input images and can be used for tasks like dimensionality reduction, denoising, and anomaly detection.
